# Deep Sketch Network for Million-scale Sketch Recognition
This Deep Sketch Network(DSN) is implemented with Pytorch to recognize sketch drawing. It is an experimental game in a playful way to show how AI works. The dataset includes 50M+ sketch drawings and 340 categories. Each category includes 15K ~ 20K drawings. Advancing on the sketch recognition could greatly help OCR, ASR and NLP.
